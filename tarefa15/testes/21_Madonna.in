Let the choir sing

When you call my name

Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

?Como puede ser verdad?

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo, "Te amo"
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby
I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Te dijo, te amo
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
El dijo que te ama
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa (Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
La Isla Bonita
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Spanish lullaby

I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was until I found you
I was beat, incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue, but you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats next to mine

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you, 'cause only love can last
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold, oh your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out what was scared and cold

Like a virgin (Hey)
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa, ah
Whoa whoa whoa

You're so fine and you're mine
I'll be yours 'til the end of time 'cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel I've nothing to hide

Like a virgin (Hey)
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

Like a virgin
Ooh-ooh, like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me, and your heart beats, and you love me
Oh-ooh oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh baby, yeah
Can't you hear my heart beat for the very first time?

Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit, I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (That's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash is always Mister Right

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest, then I have to let them be
Some boys try, and some boys lie
But I don't let them play, no way
Only boys that save their pennies make my rainy day

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world (-Terial)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (-Terial)
Living in a material world

Boys may come, and boys may go
And that's all right, you see
Experience has made me rich, and now they're after me

'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

A material, a material, a material, a material world
Living in a material world (-Terial)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (-Terial)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (-Terial)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (-Terial)
Living in a material world

Waiting for your call, baby, night and day

The lights are on, but there's no one home
Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two
And I'm done, I'm hanging up on you

I can't keep on waiting for you
I know that you're still hesitating
Don't cry for me, 'cause I'll find my way
You'll wake up one day, but it'll be too late

Every little thing that you say or do

And we can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right
It's a sacrifice

What I need right now
Is some good advice, please

I want somebody to speed it up for me, then take it down slow
There's enough room for both
Well, I can handle that, you just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go? Are you ready to go?
(Fikki fikki, fikki fikki, come on)
If you want it, you already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real just
Say the word, and I'mma give you what you want

It's a beautiful life, but I'm not concerned
It's a beautiful dream, but a dream is earned
I can dress like a boy, I can dress like a girl
Keep your beautiful words, 'cause I'm not concerned

'Cause your world is such a shame
'Cause your world's obsessed with fame
'Cause your world's in so much pain
'Cause your world is, 'cause your world is
Up in flames

It's a beautiful plan (Hmm), but I'm not concerned (Oh, yeah)
It's a beautiful game (Hmm) that I never learned
People tell me to shut my mouth (Shut your mouth), that I might get burned
Keep your beautiful lies (Hmm) 'cause I'm not concerned

'Cause your world is such a shame
'Cause your world's obsessed with fame
'Cause your world's in so much pain
'Cause your world is, 'cause your world is--

I will not denounce the things that I have said
I will not renounce my faith in my sweet Lord
He has chosen me to fight against the English
And I'm not afraid at all to die 'cause I believe Him
God is on my side and I'll be His bride
I am not afraid 'cause I have faith in Him
You can cut my hair and throw me in a jail cell
Say that I'm a witch and burn me at the stake
It's all a big mistake
Don't you know to doubt Him is a sin?
I won't give in
They are so naive
They think we are not aware of their crimes
We know, but we are just not ready to act
The storm isn't in the air, it's inside of us
I want to tell you about love and loneliness
But it's getting late now
Can't you hear outside of your Supreme hoodie
The wind that's beginning to howl?

It's a beautiful life

Everybody knows the damn truth
Our nation lied, we lost respect
When we wake up, what can we do?
Get the kids ready, take them to school
Everybody knows they don't have a chance
To get a decent job, to have a normal life
When they talk reforms, it makes me laugh
They pretend to help, it makes me laugh
I think I understand why people get a gun
I think I understand why we all give up
Every day they have a kind of victory
Blood of innocence, spread everywhere
They say that we need love
But we need more than this

We lost God control
We lost God control
We lost God control
We lost God control

This is your wake-up call
I'm like your nightmare
I'm here to start your day
This is your wake-up call
We don't have to fall
A new democracy
God and pornography
A new democracy
People think that I'm insane
The only gun is in my brain
Each new birth, it gives me hope
That's why I don't smoke that dope
Insane people think I am
Brain inside my only friend
Hope it gives me birth each new
That dope I don't smoke, it's true

Everybody knows the damn truth
Everybody knows the damn truth (Wake up)
We need to wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
We need to make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up
It's a hustle, yeah
It's a hustle
It's a con
It's a hustle
It's a weird kind of energy, a bizarre thing that happens to be
An abnormal fraternity, and I feel more than sympathy
We got to wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
We need to make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up

People think that I'm insane
The only gun is in my brain
Each new birth, it gives me hope
That's why I don't smoke that dope
Insane people think I am
Brain inside my only friend
Hope it gives me birth each new
That dope I don't smoke, it's true
Everybody knows the damn truth
Everybody knows the damn truth
We got to wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
(Wake up)
Ah (Ah), Ah (Ah)

A new democracy!

Everybody knows the damn truth
Our nation lied, we've lost respect
When we wake up, what can we do
Get the kids ready, take them to school
Everybody knows they don't have a chance
Get a decent job, have a normal life
When they talk reforms, it makes me laugh
They pretend to help, it makes me laugh

We lost God control
We lost God control
We lost God control
We lost God control
We lost God control
(Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)

You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen when your heart's not open
You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken when your heart's not open

Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you, my heart will be broken
Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen when your heart's not open

Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen when your heart's not open

Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key
If I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

If I could melt your heart

(Hoo!)
(Hoo!)
Come on, girls!
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down
(You'll never come down)
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own
(Baby, on your own)

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey

What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down
(You'll never come down)

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees, so please

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
Express yourself
(You've got to make him) So you can respect yourself
Hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
Express yourself

Hey Mr. DJ, put a record on

Boogie-woogie, do you like my acid rock?

Hey Mr. DJ, put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby
And when the music starts, I never wanna stop
It's gonna drive me crazy

Music, music, music, music, music, music, music, music, music
Music, makes the people come together
Music, makes the bourgeoisie and the rebel

Don't think of yesterday and I don't look at the clock
I like to boogie-woogie (Uh-uh!)
It's like ridin' on the wind and it never goes away
Touches everything I'm in, got to have it every day
Music, makes the people come together, yeah
Music, makes the bourgeoisie and the rebel

Hey, Mr. DJ

Do you like to?
Boogie-woogie, do you like to?
Boogie-woogie, do you like to?

Wake up, ex-wife
This is your life
Children, on your own
Turning on the telephone
Messages, manager
No time for a manicure
Working out, shake my ass
I know how to multitask
Connecting to the Wi-Fi
Went from nerd to superb
Have you seen the new guy?
I forgot the password
Gotta call the babysitter
Tweeting on the elevator
I could take a helicopter
I don't even feel the pressure

I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem, I don't give a
You were so mad at me
Who's got custody?
Lawyers, suck it up
Didn't have a pre-nup
Make a film, write a song
Gotta get my stockings on
Meet the press, buy the dress
All of this to impress
RIde my horse, break some bones
Take it down a semitone
I forgot to say my prayers
Baby Jesus on the stairs
Gotta sign a contract
Gotta get my money back
All the bottles have to go
Standing in the front row

I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem, I don't give a
I tried to be a good girl
I tried to be your wife
Diminished myself and swallowed my light
I tried to become all that you expect of me
And if it was a failure, I don't give a
(I don't give a, I-I-I don't
I don't give a, I-I-I don't
I don't give a, I-I-I don't
I don't give a)

Shots fire!
Anything you hear Nicki on, that's fire!
You don't hear them bums on nothing, that's fire!
Tell 'em, "catch fire"
In the Bugatti, ten grand, one tire
Ayo Madonna (Yes, Nicki?)
Mi yuh say you original, Don Dada
Inna ya Gabbana, inna all ya Prada!
We material girls, ain't nobody hotter
Pops collar!
See, I really can't relate to your Volvo
And you can't get these shoes at the Aldo
When I let a dude go, that's his loss
I was cutting them checks, I was his boss!
Yo, I don't give a F you, curse nor bless you
Never let 'em stress you, yo
I ain't a businesswoman, I'm a business, woman!
And I'm known for giving bitches the business, woman
I'm gonna be okay (Mama)
I don't care what the people say (Madonna!)
I'm gonna be alright (Nicki Minaj!)
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track? (Let's go)
I'm moving fast and I like it like that (Catch up)
I do ten things all at once (Mama)
And if you have a problem, I don't give a

There's only one queen and that's Madonna
Bitch!

L-U-V, Madonna
Y-O-U, you wanna?

I see you coming and I don't wanna know your name
(L-U-V, Madonna)
I see you coming and you're gonna have to change the game
(Y-O-U, you wanna?)
Would you like to try? Give me a reason why
Give me all that you got
Maybe you'll do fine as long as you don't lie to me
And pretend to be what you're not

Don't play the stupid game
'Cause I'm a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You've got to step into my world

Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Give me all your love today
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Let's forget about time, and dance our lives away
L-U-V, Madonna
Y-O-U, you wanna?

Keep trying, don't give up, that's if you want it bad enough
(L-U-V, Madonna)
It's right in front of you, now tell me what you're thinking of
(Y-O-U, you wanna?)
In another place, at a different time
You can be my lucky star
We can drink some wine, Burgundy is fine
Let's drink the bottle every drop

Don't play the stupid game
'Cause I'm a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You've got to step into my world

Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Give me all your love today
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Let's forget about time, and dance our lives away
(Gimme all your love)
Give me all your love, boy
You can be my boy, you can be my boy toy
In the nick of time, I can say a sicker rhyme
'Cause it's time for change, like a nickel or a dime
(Gimme all your love)
Ugh, I'm Roman, I'm a barbarian, I'm Conan
You was sleeping on me, you were dozin'
Now move, I'm goin' in

You have all the L-U-V
I gave you everything you need (Now move!)
Now it's up to Y-O-U
Are you the one? Shall we proceed?

Move, it! Licks
I'm some swag shit, no one gives you this
It's supersonic, bionic, uranium hit
So I break 'em off tricks, let's pray that it sticks
I'mma say this once, yeah, I don't give a shit

Don't play the stupid game
'Cause I'm a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You've got to step into my world
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
(L-U-V, Madonna)
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
(Y-O-U, you wanna?)
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Gimme all your love today
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Let's forget about time, and dance our lives away

Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one

And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light, then gone for
Someone else will be there
Through the endless years

She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
And I feel
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light, she's flying
Quicker than a ray of light, I'm flying

Us kids don't know what we're talking about
That we're too young to understand how the government works
We call B. S.

I'm goin' through it, yeah
I know you see the tragic in it
Just hold on to the little bit of magic in it
I can't break down now
I can't take that now
Died a thousand times
Managed to survive
I can't break down now
I can't take that (I can't take that)

I rise, I rise
I rise up above it, up above it
I rise, I rise
I rise up above it all

There's nothin' you can do to me that hasn't been done
Not bulletproof, shouldn't have to run from a gun
River of tears ran dry, let 'em run
No game that you can play with me, I ain't won
'Cause I'm goin' through it, yeah
I know you see the tragic in it (Alright)
Just hold on to the little bit of magic in it (Yeah)
I can't break down now
I can't take that now (I can't take that now)
Died a thousand times
Managed to survive (I managed to survive)
I can't break down now
I can't take that (I can't take that)

(I rise) I rise, I rise
(Rise) I rise up above it, up above it
(I rise) I rise, I rise
(Rise) I rise up above it all

I managed to survive
(B. S.)
Freedom's what you choose to do with what's been done to you
No one can hurt you now unless you want them to
(Unless you want)
No one can hurt you now unless you love 'em too (B. S.)
Unless you love 'em too
'Cause I'm going through it
Yeah, I know you see the tragic in it
Just hold on to the little bit of magic in it (Magic in it)
I can't break down now
I can't take that (I can't take that)

(I rise) I rise, I rise
(Rise) I rise up above it, up above it

(Rise) I rise up above it all

Yeah, we gonna rise up (I will rise)

Yes, we can, we can get it together (I will rise)
We'll rise up, we can get it together
Yeah, we gonna rise up (I will rise)
Yeah, we gonna rise up
Yeah, we gonna get up
Yeah, we gonna get up
Yeah, we gonna get up
Yes, we can, we can get it together (I will rise)
We'll rise up, we can get it together

Swaying room, as the music starts
Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two, their bodies become one
I see you through the smokey air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare?
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you

Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at all
Slowly now, we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see
I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
You'll feel it in my kiss
Because I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you
Crazy for you
Crazy for you

It's all brand new
I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true
I'm crazy, crazy for you
It's all brand new, I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true
Yeah, I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you, baby
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you, baby
