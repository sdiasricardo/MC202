If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin'
On the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard

Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol

Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm looking, babe

Just tell me how it's looking, babe
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
(How it's looking, babe?)

And tell me how it's looking babe
(How it's looking, babe?)
Tell me how it's looking babe, looking babe
Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say "Speed it up", I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
Ya man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue
'Cause when he wanna smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yonce all on his mouth like liquor

Driver, roll up the partition, please
I don't need you seeing 'Yonce on her knees
Took forty-five minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club
Now my mascara running, red lipstick smudged
Oh, he so horny, yeah, he want to fuck
He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse
He Monica Lewinsky'd all on my gown

Oh there, daddy, daddy didn't bring the towel
Oh, baby, baby, we better slow it down
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club

Take all of me, I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like
Take all of me, I just wanna be the girl you like
The kinda girl you like is right here with me

Driver, roll up the partition fast (Hey)
Driver, roll up the partition fast
Over there, I swear I saw them cameras flash
Handprints and footprints on my glass
Handprints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blasting
He like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty
Red wine drip, we'll talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdropping, trying not to crash

Oh there, daddy, daddy didn't bring the towel
Oh, baby, baby, we better slow it down
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club

Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe ?
Le sexe, je veux dire : l'activite physique, le coit. Tu aimes ca ?
Tu ne t'interesses pas au sexe ?
Les hommes pensent que les feministes detestent le sexe mais c'est une activite tres stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent

The kinda girl you like is right here with me (Hello!)

Bzz-bzz-bzz-bzz-bzz-bzzwop

I've been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my, oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh
'Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far
If we are, we're taking this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're taking this a little too far
Me being wherever I'm at, worried about wherever you are
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far

Do it big, do it all for a good girl

On my mind, up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away, all that I can think of is
We should get married, we should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away

Stop making a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things

Don't sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl?
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup?
From eight until late, I think 'bout you
You own my nights, I don't know what to do, do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep
This whole thing got way too deep and we should

Stop making a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

You gon' make me have to pull up on you
Don't go ghost on me, I'ma go Thriller on you, I'ma just (Pull up on you)
I'ma let my hands do the talking when I see you baby girl
I miss feeling on you,( Pull up on you) I miss everything that's real about you
And that's everything about you that's just how I feel about you (Pull up on you)
I been about you and I'm still about you but
We ain't finished talking (Pull up on you)
I told you you don't need to worry about them bitches
All them fives need to listen when the ten is talking (Pull up on you)
'Cause they don't wanna see you happier than them
And girl you swear they all ya friends and that's been a problem (Pull up on you)
You the one they hate, just come with that
I know you think it's funny that your ex is not a running back
But that nigga came running back
(Pull up on you) And you tell me that you're done with that
And I believe it's true
As long as you know who you belong to

All I'm really asking for is you
Long as you know who you belong to

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one
What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous and crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

I hop up out my bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up
I hop up out my bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up

Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry

He trying to roll me up (I ain't sorry)
I ain't picking up (I ain't sorry)
Headed to the club (I ain't sorry)
I ain't thinking 'bout you (I ain't sorry)
Me and my ladies sip my D'USSe cups
I don't give a fuck, chucking my deuces up
Suck on my balls, pause, I had enough (Sorry, I ain't sorry)
I ain't thinking 'bout you
I ain't thinking 'bout

Middle fingers up, put them hands high
Wave it in his face, tell him, boy, bye (Sorry, I ain't sorry)
Tell him, boy, bye, boy, bye, middle fingers up
I ain't thinking 'bout you

Sorry, I ain't sorry (You)
Sorry, I ain't sorry (You)
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
I ain't thinking 'bout you
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry, I ain't sorry
No, no, hell nah
Now you wanna say you're sorry
Now you wanna call me crying
Now you gotta see me wilding
Now I'm the one that's lying
And I don't feel bad about it
It's exactly what you get
Stop interrupting my grinding
(You interrupting my grinding)
I ain't thinking 'bout you

Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't thinking 'bout you
I ain't thinking 'bout you
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't thinking 'bout you
I ain't thinking 'bout you

Middle fingers up, put them hands high
Wave it in his face, tell him, boy, bye (Bye) (Sorry, I ain't sorry)
Tell him, boy, bye (Bye), boy, bye (Bye)
Middle fingers up, I ain't thinking 'bout you

Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry
No, no, hell nah
Looking at my watch, he shoulda been home
Today, I regret the night I put that ring on
He always got them fucking excuses
I pray to the Lord you reveal what his truth is

I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I'd know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
(Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy...

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
Halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burnin' through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
Halo
Halo
Ooh

Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
Halo, oh oh
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
Halo

You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world

Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray you catch me

Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray to catch you whispering (Whisper, whisper)
I pray you catch me (Whisper, whisper)
I pray you catch me
I pray you catch me (Pray you)
I'm praying you catch me
What are you doing, my love?

I found the truth beneath your lies
And true love never has to hide
True love never has to hide
I'll trade your broken wings for mine
Trade your broken wings for mine
I've seen your scars and kissed your crime, oh
Seen your scars and kissed your crime

So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long
Our love was stronger than your pride
Beyond your darkness, I'm your light, oh
If you get deep, you touch my mind
If you get deep, you touch my mind
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes, oh
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes

So many people, I know that they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

They say true love's the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain, pain
But every diamond has imperfections
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away
Boy, nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became my remedy
So many people, I know that they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

How I missed you, my love

"Your challengers are a young group from Houston
Welcome Beyonce, Lativia, Nina, Nicky, Kelly and Ashley

I'm out that H-Town, comin'-- comin' down
I'm comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
H--H-Town--Town, I'm comin' down
Comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground

I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down, bitches (Crown)
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down, bitches
Bow down, bitches-- Bow-- Bow down, bitches (Crown)
Bow down, bitches-- Bow-- Bow down, bitches (Crown)
H-Town vicious, H--H-Town vicious

We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: "You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man"
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important (C--Candy on the ground)
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support (Dum-dah-de-da)
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same? (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing (Com--Com--Comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground)
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are (Dum-dah-de-da)
Feminist: A person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)

Tryna rain, tryna rain on the thunder
Tell the storm I'm new
I'ma walk, I'ma march on the regular
Painting white flags blue
Lord, forgive me, I've been running
Running blind in truth
I'ma rain, I'ma rain on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I'm new

I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away," oh
May the last one burn into flames

Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose! Yeah
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
'Cause I need freedom, too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

I'ma wade, I'ma wave through the waters
Tell the tide, "Don't move"
I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders
Call me bulletproof
Lord, forgive me, I've been runnin'
Runnin' blind in truth
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through your shallow love
Tell the deep I'm new
I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away," oh
May the last one burn into flames

Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
'Cause I need freedom, too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves
Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice
Channel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards
Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights wavin' in my direction (Come on)
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Honestly guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me, like yeah
Open correctional gates in higher desert (Yeah)
Open our mind as we cast away oppression (Yeah)
Open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
'Cause I need freedom, too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

Is it truth you seek? Oh, father, can you hear me?

Let me sit this ass on you, show you how I feel
Let me take this off, will you watch me
Yes, mass appeal
Don't take your eyes, don't take your eyes off it
Watch it, babe
If you like, you can touch me, baby
Do you, do you wanna touch me, baby?
Grab a hold, don't let go
Let me know, that you, ready
I just wanna show you now, slow it down, go around
You rock hard, I rock steady

And rock right up to, the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, your deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, babe, over me

Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Bathe in these waterfalls
I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this bass, when you put it in your face
By the way, if you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be a piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create rockets and waterfalls

So rock right up to, the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, your deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me babe, over me

Hard, rock, steady, rock, hard, rock, steady
Rock, hard, rock, steady, rock, hard, rock, steady

Don't you know that I give you the loving if you need it
I give you my word, you can believe it
Your love feels like all four seasons growing inside me
Life has a reason, swimming in my love, your love lifting
Higher, harder
Got me screaming to the Lord, boy
Kiss me, pray we don't overflow
Baby, I know you can feel it pulse
Keeping the peak of my waterfall
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, rock it 'til the water falls
Damn
I can't help but love the way we make love
Daddy, daddy
Ooh child, ooh now, yes Lord, damn baby
Driving me cray, cray
You ain't right for doing it to me like that daddy
Even though I've been a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad girl
Tell me what you're gonna do about that
Punish me, please
Punish me please
Daddy, what you gon' do with all this ass
All up in your face?
Yeah, hell yeah, ride me so deep
Ooh, my shit's so good that it ain't even right
I know I'm right
Hell yeah, you the shit
That's why you're my equivalent
So sexy
We're so much more than pointless fixtures
Instagram pictures, consumers
What about that ching-ching-ching
Wanna rock that, wanna rock that ching-ching
Baby boomers, baby, baby, baby, baby
Cyclical trends, tryna fit in
Home is where the heart is
Goddamnit, I'm comfortable in my skin
And you're comfortable in my skin
You look so comfortable in my skin
Rockets and waterfalls
Damn

We built sandcastles that washed away
I made you cry when I walked away, oh
And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, oh, babe
Every promise don't work out that way

Dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I can't erase, baby?
When every promise don't work out that way, no, no, babe
When every promise don't work out that way

And your heart is broken 'cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away, oh
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, no, no, no, no, no
Every promise don't work out that way
