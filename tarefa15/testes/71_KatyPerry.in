They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the fuck?

A tiger
Don't lose no sleep
Don't need opinions
From a shellfish or a sheep
Don't you come for me
No, not today
You're calculated
I got your number
'Cause you're a joker
And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring
You best believe

So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth
'Cause I stay winning
Lay 'em up like
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket

Your game is tired
You should retire
You're 'bout cute as
An old coupon expired
And karma's not a liar
She keeps receipts

So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth
'Cause I stay winning
Lay 'em up like

Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket

They just know what is what
Young Money
But they don't know what is what
They just know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
Hahaha, yo
What the fuck?
Pink Ferragamo sliders on deck
Silly rap beefs just get me more checks
My life is a movie, I'm never off set
Me and my amigos (no, not Offset)
Swish swish, aww I got them upset
But my shooters'll make 'em dance like dubstep
Swish, swish, aww, my haters is obsessed
'Cause I make M's, they get much less
Don't be tryna double back
I already despise you
All that fake love you showin'
Couldn't even disguise you
Ran? When? Nicki gettin' tan
Mirror mirror who's the fairest bitch in all the land?
Damn, man, this bitch is a Stan
Muah, muah, the generous queen will kiss a fan
Ass goodbye, I'ma be riding by
I'ma tell my ----- Biggz, yeah that's tha guy
A star's a star, da ha da ha
They never thought the swish god would take it this far
Get my pimp cup, this is pimp shit, baby
I only rock with Queens, so I'm makin' hits with Katy
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket

They know what is what
Do they know?
But they don't know what is what
They just know what is what
But they don't know what is what

What the...

Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ay, up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we're about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions
(Woo!)

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

Turn it up
Turn it up
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
'Cause we're all chained to the rhythm

Yeah, y'all know what it is
Katy Perry, Juicy J
Uh-huh, let's rage!

I knew you were, you were gonna come to me
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything

Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy (Enemy)
Your enemy (Your enemy), your enemy

So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back
Mark my words, this love will make you levitate
Like a bird, like a bird without a cage
We're down to earth if you choose to walk away
Don't walk away (Walk away)

It's in the palm of your hand now, baby
It's a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it all to me
All to me, give it all to me

So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

She's a beast, I call her Karma (Come back)
She eat your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer (Woo!)
Be careful, try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart is on steroids, 'cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love when you meet her (Meet her)
If you get the chance, you better keep her (Keep her)
She's sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer (Freezer)
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my sleeping beauty, I'm gon' put her in a coma (Woo!)
Damn, I think I love her, shawty's so bad
I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster, turn the bedroom into a fair (A fair)
Her love is like a drug, I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil mama so dope, I messed around and got addicted
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for (You should know)
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse (Like a dark horse)
Are you ready for, ready for (Ready for)
A perfect storm, perfect storm? (A perfect storm)
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

If she do right, told her get whatever you like
Offset

Make her do a donut when she ride, aight
Looking at the eyes of a dime, make you blind
In her spine and my diamonds change the climate

Whipped cream, no dairy
Got her hot light on, screaming, "I'm ready"
But no horses, no carriage

Under candlelight (Yeah, woo)
Bon appetit, baby

I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar
Now I'm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Got up)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

I'm losing my self-control
Yeah, you're starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again

I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
And I think of you

Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
I guess I could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain
'Cause I can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name

I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
I think of you

Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over, yeah

Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
(And I'll have to get over you all over again)
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
(Over you all over again)

Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over

Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

But in another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one
The one
The one
The one that got away

All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

The one (The one)
The one (The one)
The one (The one)
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
'Cause my roots, they run deep, oh

(Oh, ye of so little faith)
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
(Victory is in my veins)
I know it, I know it
(And I will not negotiate)
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform

When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, "You're out of time."
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise
I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say...

(Oh, ye of so little faith)
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
(Victory is in your veins)
You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed

'Cause when, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, "You're out of time."
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

(Don't doubt it, don't doubt it)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(You know it, you know it)
Still rise
(Just fight it, just fight it)
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey

I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (Undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryna creep a little sneak peek (At us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Sex (Sex) on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep  *horn honks* 
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, oh-oh

You could travel the world (You could travel the world)
But nothing comes close to the golden coast

These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns (Uh!)
The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep and live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the Bay just like I love L. A
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just the king and a queenie
Katy, my lady (Yeah?)
Lookie here, baby (Uh-huh)
I'm all up on ya
'Cause you representin' California (Oh-oh, yeah)
California girls, we're unforgettable

California girls, man
(California) Hahahaha
(California Girls)
I really wish you all could be California girls

Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (Smile)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (Smile)

Every day, Groundhog Day
Goin' through motions felt so fake
Not myself, not my best
Felt like I failed the test

But every tear has been a lesson
Rejection can be God's protection
Long hard road to get that redemption
But no shortcuts to a blessin'

Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (Smile)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (Smile)
I'm 2.0, remodeled
Used to be dull, now I sparkle
Had a piece of humble pie
That ego check saved my life

Now I got a smile like Lionel Richie
Big and bright, need shades just to see me
Tryna stay alive just like I'm the Bee Gees (Oh, woah)
A Mona Lisa masterpiece (Now I'm)

Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (C'mon, smile, woo)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful (So grateful)
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (Smile, oh, oh)

I'm so thankful
'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally
I'm so grateful
'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally (Oh)
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (Woo, smile)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (Smile, oh, oh)

I'm so thankful
'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally
Smile (Oh)
I'm so grateful
'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally
Smile (Oh, oh)

You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me, I was alright
But things were kinda heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece, I'm complete
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)

(You) You make me (Make me)
Feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back (No)
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real (Oh), so take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)

You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS like a bitch, I would know
And you overthink, always speak cryptically
I should know that you're no good for me

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

We used to be just like twins, so in sync
The same energy now's a dead battery
Used to laugh (Used to laugh) 'bout nothing ('Bout nothing)
Now you're plain (Now you're plain) boring (Boring)
I should know (I should know)
That you're not gonna change
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You) You don't really wanna stay, no (Oh)
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh (Oh)
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
You change your mind like a girl changes clothes

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You) You don't really wanna stay, no (Oh)
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh (Oh)
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

Told them your dreams, and they all started laughing
I guess you're out of your mind 'til it actually happens

I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?

They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

When did we all stop believing in magic?
Why did we put all our hopes in a box in the attic?

I'm the long shot
I'm the Hail Mary
Why can't it be me?
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down (Knock me down)
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

Hey, hey
Oh, cover me in daisies
Hey, hey

I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?

They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out (Count me out)
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbeque
This a hickey or a bruise?

Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a menage a trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-whoa
But this Friday night, do it all again
But this Friday night, do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

If I lost it all today, would you stay?
Could my love be enough to stimulate?
If shit hit the fan, grenades got thrown
Would you still show, oh?
Could you go down with me to the mat?
Could we get back up and eventually laugh?
Roll eyes at highs, cheers in the lows, and stay in the flow, whoa

'Cause I, I only got this life
And I ain't got the time, no
Not to get it right, oh

We're all just looking for connection
Yeah, we all want to be seen
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language
Someone to ride this ride with me
Can I get a witness? (Witness)
Will you be my witness? (Witness)
I'm just looking for a witness in all of this
Looking for a witness to get me through this

When you tell me everything, and there's no holes
You can scroll through anything, you've got the codes
Nothing to hide, it's all in their eyes
And we just know, whoa
'Cause I, I only got this life
And I ain't got the time, no
Not to get it right, oh

We're all just looking for connection
Yeah, we all want to be seen

Will you be my witness?
Could you be the one that speaks for me?
Will you be my witness?

We're all just looking for connection (We're all just looking)
Yeah, we all want to be seen
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language
Someone (To ride this ride) to ride this ride with me (With me)

Oh-oh-oh-oh (Ah)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Hey (Ah)
Oh-oh-oh
Hey

You love the hell out of me
And Heaven's where we could be
I've stood on the edge of love
But never took the leap
And you took my armor off
And did it delicately
And I let my guard down
To show you what's underneath

Thank God that you were man enough to come
Answer my mama's prayers
You asked the question, I said, "Yes"
But I'm scared

'Cause I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
Yeah, I really wanna try with you
No, I've never worn white
But I'm standin' here tonight
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"
I do

See us in sixty years with a full family tree (I do)
Give my blood, sweat, and tears to reach our destiny (I do)
'Cause love is a minefield, let's take this war, baby (I do)
'Cause at the end of it all, I choose you and you choose me (I do)
Thank God I was woman enough to come
Answer your father's prayers
You asked the question
I could tell you were scared

'Cause I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
Yeah, I really wanna try with you
No, I've never worn white
But I'm standin' here tonight
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"

Now let's dance with each other (Dance with each other)
Mixing all of our colors
It's so easy to surrender
When you finally find forever

No, I've never worn white, no
But I really wanna try with you
Yeah, I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"
'Cause I do
Oh, I do, yeah, yeah
I do

You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

This is transcendental
On another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wavelength
And be there when you vibrate
For you, I'll risk it all, all
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

Boy, tell me, can you take my breath away?
Cruisin' down a heart-shaped highway
Got you swervin' lane-to-lane, don't hit the brakes
'Cause I'm feelin' so safe

I'll be your baby, on a Sunday
Oh, why don't we get out of town?
Call me your baby, on the same wave
Oh, no, no, there's no slowin' down

You and I, I
Ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i
I'm on the back, I'm holdin' tight, I
Want you to take me for a ride, ride
When I hula-hula, hula
So good, you'll take me to the jeweler-jeweler, jeweler
There's pink and purple in the sky-y-y
We're ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i (Ha)

Let me run my fingers through your salty hair
Go ahead, explore the island
Vibes so real that you can feel it in the air
I'm revvin' up your engine
I'll be your baby, on a Sunday
Oh, why don't we get out of town? (Why don't we get out of town?)
Call me your baby, catch the same wave

I heard you're feeling nothing's going right
Why don't you let me stop by?
The clock is ticking, running out of time
So we should party all night

So cover your eyes, I have a surprise
I hope you got a healthy appetite
If you wanna dance, if you want it all
You know that I'm the girl that you should call (Come on)

You're never gonna be unsatisfied
If you wanna dance, if you want it all (All)
You know that I'm the girl that you should call (Yeah)

Oh, did I almost see what's really on the inside?
All your insecurities
All the dirty laundry
Never made me blink one time

Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
There is no fear now
Let go and just be free

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard
With an open heart (I'm wide awake)
How did I read the stars so wrong? (I'm wide awake)
And now it's clear to me
That everything you see
Ain't always what it seems (I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long

I wish I knew then, what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete

Falling from cloud nine
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine
I'm wide awake
Not losing any sleep
I picked up every piece
And landed on my feet (I'm wide awake)
Need nothing to complete myself, no (I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den
I don't have to pretend (And it's too late)
The story's over now, the end

I wish I knew then, what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete

Falling from cloud nine (It was out of the blue, I'm)
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)
I'm falling from cloud nine (I'm wide awake)

Thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling (I'm wide awake)
I am trying to hold on (I'm wide awake)
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side (I'm wide awake)
But I'm not blind anymore
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine (It was out of the blue, I'm)
Crashing from the high
You know, I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)

"You know, sometimes you can be blinded by your extreme emotions. I definitely was looking for answers, during that time when I wrote that song, and yeah, I was depressed and sad, and there were thoughts, but there were never actions, thankfully. But I wanted to share that side of my story, because I know there are so many other people out there that have gone through things like that, and you always feel like you're the only one going through that. You walk out the door, and you see someone you know, and they ask you how you are, and you just have to say you're fine when you're not really fine, but you just can't get into it, because they would never understand. Well, then comes along a song that speaks to you, that makes you feel like 'Gosh, I can get through this if she can get through this, I can get through this.'"

Your mind may refuse to believe
Your mind may refuse to believe

I hope you hang yourself with your HM scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don't eat meat
And drive electrical cars

You're so sad, maybe you should buy a happy meal
You're so skinny, you should really Super Size the deal
Secretly you're so amused that nobody understands you
I'm so mean 'cause I cannot get you out of your head
I'm so angry 'cause you'd rather MySpace instead
I can't believe I fell in love with someone that wears more makeup
And

Days like this, I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade

You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me drown
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Now look at me, I'm sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won't ever put me out again
I'm glowing, oh whoa
So you can keep the diamond ring
It don't mean nothing anyway
In fact you can keep everything
Yeah, yeah, except for me
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no (Away from me)

Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul (My soul)
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

This is the part of me (No)
Away from me (No)
This is the part of me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
No

Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Isn't it strange that you used to know me?
All the highs and lows and in-betweens
And now you see me and just say, "Hey"
Isn't it weird that you've seen me naked?
We had conversations 'bout forever
Now it's 'bout the weather, okay

And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers
Yeah

Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk

Isn't it wild that I know your weakness?
And everybody at the party thinks
That you're the best since sliced bread
And isn't it awkward I got a new somebody?
And honestly it'll probably be a while before we can just be friends
I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers
(Small talk)

Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been (Hands haven't been)
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk

Blah-blah-blah-blah
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk
Blah-blah-blah-blah (Nothing left, nothing left, baby)
Blah-blah-blah-blah (Nah)
Blah-blah-blah-blah (Oh no)
Now there's nothing left but small talk
And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers

Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been (Oh)
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk
(Now there's nothing left but small talk)

Blah-blah-blah-blah
Blah-blah-blah-blah (Blah-blah-blah)
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk (Now there's nothing left)
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Blah-blah-blah-blah (Small talk)
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk

Comparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one
I still got the seed

You said move on, where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know

'Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you (Thinking of you, thinking of you)
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was
Spending the night (Spending the night, spending the night)
Oh, I wish that I
Was looking into your eyes

Oh, oh

You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter
Like a hard candy with a surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best?
You said there's tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test
He kissed my lips, I taste your mouth (I taste your mouth)
Oh, he pulled me in, I was disgusted with myself

'Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you (Thinking of you, thinking of you)
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was
Spending the night (Spending the night, spending the night)
Oh, I wish that I
Was looking into your...

The best
And yes, I do regret
How I could let myself let you go
Now, now the lesson's learned
I touched it, I was burned
Oh, I think you should know

'Cause when I'm with him (Oh)
I am thinking of you (Oh) (Thinking of you, thinking of you)
Thinking of you (Oh)
What you would do if
You were the one who was
Spending the night (Spending the night, spending the night)
Oh, I wish that I
Was looking into your, your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Oh, won't you walk through
And bust in the door and
Take me away?
Oh, no more mistakes
'Cause in your eyes, I'd like to stay
Stay

I was fine before I met you
Truth is that I lost myself inside you
It is not fair to put all that on you
But you took control of a vulnerable soul (Yeah)
I am my mother's daughter
And there are so many things I love about her
But I have, I have to break the cycle
So I can sit first at the dinner table

You can't clip my wings, can't wilt my flowers
Stole my time, but I'll make up the hours
'Cause I'm a goddess and you know it
Some respect, you better show it
I'm done with you siphoning my power
Power

Hell hath no fury like a woman reborn
And now I'm burning like a blue flame once more
But don't mistake my warmth for weakness
Don't bite the hand that feeds or you'll
You'll never eat, no-oh

You can't clip my wings, can't wilt my flowers
Stole my time, but I'll make up the hours
'Cause I'm a goddess and you know it
Some respect, you better show it
I'm done with you siphoning my power
Power (Hey)
And now I'm taking it back
Electric as fuck (C'mon)
You can't quiet this thunder, no (No-oh-oh)
Yeah, I'm taking it back
Lit all the way up
Even in the dark, I glow (I glow, I glow)

You can't clip my wings, can't wilt my flowers
Stole my time, but I'll make up the hours, oh
'Cause I'm a goddess and you know it
Some respect, you better show it
I'm done with you siphoning my power
Power

I live off the echoes of your "I love you's"
But I still feel the blows from all of your "don't want to's" (Yeah)
When you're drunk, you say I'm the one
Then you wake up
You suck my hope up in a vacuum

'Cause every day's the same
Definition of insane
I think we're running on a loop
Deja vu
So tell me something new
Figure out the Rubik's Cube
I think we're running on a loop
Deja vu

Your words are like Chinese water torture
And there's no finish line, always one more corner
Yeah, they slither like a centipede
Why do you keep me
At the end of a rope that keeps getting shorter?

'Cause every day's the same
Definition of insane
I think we're running on a loop
Deja vu
So tell me something new
Figure out the Rubik's Cube
I think we're running on a loop

Deja vu (Deja, deja, deja vu)

Deja vu

I'm uptight
Playing by the rules in this game of life
365 days on the grind
Something's stirring, I might need to unwind
Then, there's you
Texting me a little bubble of trouble
I've tried to ignore these thoughts that rumble
I think I'm bored of being so careful

Big city lights
Got me flirting with fire
Tonight I'ma let my hair down
Have a few rounds and just let go

Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna lose control and forget with you
Like roulette (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Let's roll it (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

They say everything in moderation
And sometimes, you got to give in to temptation
So I drop a pin to my location
Let's roll the dice
Big city lights
Got me flirting with fire
Tonight I'ma let my hair down
Have a few rounds and just let go

Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna lose control and forget with you
Oh, like roulette (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Let's roll it (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Like roulette (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Let's roll it (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

So tonight, we test limits (Test limits)
Take the safety off for a minute (For a minute)
'Cause my love's a bullet with your name written on it
Just load it and spin it

Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you (Close my eyes with you)
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna lose control and forget with you (Lose control, lose control)
Like roulette (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Let's roll it (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

Saw your picture on accident
Your face has changed
The lines are sinking in
I pressed play, I should haven't
Congratulations
But do you ever wonder what we could have been?
(I wonder what we could have been)

But your mind plays tricks with distance
Always makes things feel so unfinished

I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)

I saw a balloon floating away
I thought, "Did someone let go, or did they lose it?"
So strange, you know all my secrets
Please keep them safe
And darling, you know that I'll do the same
(You know that I'll do the same)
Though we're no longer in existence
Baby, you'll always be in my orbit

I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)
I miss you more than I loved you
Oh, I do
I miss you more than I loved you

We were a match, but not a fit
We were a dream, unrealistic
We didn't lose, we didn't win
(Sometimes I wonder what we could have been)
Oh

I miss you more than I loved you
Oh, I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)
I miss you more than I loved you
(Though we're no longer in existence)
Oh, I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(You'll always be in my orbit)
Ohh-oh-oh-oh (You'll always be in my orbit)
No-oh-oh-oh-oh (You'll always be in my orbit)

I remember when you used to be my every other thought
But now my calendar's so full, it's easier to move on
Sometimes I swear I pass your SUV on Sunset Boulevard
I don't fuck with change, but lately, I've been flipping coins a lot

I struggle
I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie
'Cause I know better, baby
I write it
Erase it
Repeat it
But what good will it do to reopen the wound?
So I take a deep breath and I save as draft

You don't have to subtweet me
My number's always been the same
But all's been said and done
Will we ever really close this case?
Yeah, I will always be here for you, but I could no longer stay
Still my body goes in shock every time I hear your name
I struggle
I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie
'Cause I know better, baby
I write it
Erase it
Repeat it
But what good will it do to reopen the wound?
So I take a deep breath and I save as draft

I've heard you've done some changing
I've been rearranging
Wish that I could know, but I just don't know
Never get that time back
Fear we'd fall in old traps
Why can't we just let go?
Staring at a fork in the fucking road

I struggle
I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie (Dogs lie)
'Cause I know better, baby
I write it
Erase it
Repeat it
But what good will it do to reopen the wound?
So I take a deep breath and I save as draft

Was 27, surviving my return of Saturn
A long vacation didn't sound so bad
Was full of secrets, locked up tight like Iron Mountain
Running on empty, so out of gas

Thought I wasn't enough
Found I wasn't so tough
Laying on the bathroom floor
We were living on a fault line
And I felt the fault was all mine
Couldn't take it anymore

By the grace of God (There was no other way)
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)
I put one foot in front of the other and I
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way

I thank my sister for keeping my head above the water
When the truth was like swallowing sand
Now every morning, there is no more mourning
Oh, I can finally see myself again
I know I am enough, possible to be loved
It was not about me
Now I have to rise above
Let the universe call the bluff
Yeah, the truth will set you free

By the grace of God (There was no other way)
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)
I put one foot in front of the other and I
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out

Oh, that way, no
That way, no
Not in the name of love (In the name of love)
That way, no
That way, no
I am not giving up

By the grace of God
I picked myself back up
I put one foot in front of the other
And I looked in the mirror (Looked in the mirror)
Looked in the mirror (Looked in the mirror)
By the grace of God (By the grace of God)
(There was no other way)
I picked myself back up (Picked myself back up)
(I knew I had to stay)
I put one foot in front of the other and I (In front of the other)
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way

It's not the end of the world
No, not the end of the world
Throw on your fancy attire, fears in the fire
Don't lose hope
It's no funeral we're attending
Actually, just the beginning
Throw on your fancy attire, fears in the fire
Don't lose hope
It's not the end of the, no, not the end of the world

You can catch a star if the sky is falling down
There's a golden lining up in every single cloud
You can take a frown, turn it all the way around
All the way around, all the, all the way around
A fortune teller told me, "The power's in your mind"
You might see a cliff, but I see a way to fly
Flipping off the flop, now I just enjoy the ride
Just enjoy the ride, yeah, I just enjoy the ride

(Na, na, na, na) What a time
(Na, na, na, na) To be alive
(Don't say goodbye)
It's not the end of the world
No, not the end of the world

Don't lose hope
It's no funeral we're attending
Actually, just the beginning
Throw on your fancy attire, fears in the fire
Don't lose hope
It's not the end of the, no, not the end of the world

You can make a wish even on a satellite
On a plastic lash or anything you like
You can tame the dragon if you're not afraid to fight
Not afraid to fight, no, I'm not afraid

(Na, na, na, na) What a time
(Na, na, na, na) To be alive
(Don't say goodbye) Don't say goodbye

It's not the end of the world

Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Don't say goodbye

Please don't tip-toe
Come close, let's flow
Anchor in me, and get lost at sea
The world's your oyster and I am the pearl
Open waters
Sink into me slowly

So baby, come and take a swim with me
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy
Don't be scared to dive in deep
And start a tsunami
Tsunami

Don't fight
Just ride the rhythm of the tide
We swirl, we spin
Salted, sun-kissed skin
We float together
Whatever weather
Embrace the breeze and sail away smoothly

So baby, come and take a swim with me
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy
Don't be scared to dive in deep
And start a tsunami
Tsunami
Oh, you're waking up an ocean of emotion
That my body can't hide (Can't hide)
Tsunami (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now you're soaked in my devotion
'Cause you opened up a paradise (Inside)
Tsunami (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Tsunami

So baby, come and take a swim with me (Take a swim with me)
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy (Make me ripple, baby)
Don't be scared to dive in deep (Don't be scared to)
And start a tsunami
Tsunami

I know there's gotta be rain if I want the rainbows
And I know the higher I climb, the harder the wind blows
Yeah, I've gone to sleep night after night punching a pillow
But do you know the darker the night, the brighter the stars glow?

'Cause I am resilient
A full flower moment
Won't let the concrete hold me back, oh no
I am resilient
Born to be brilliant
You'll see me grow right through the cracks, yeah
'Cause you're gonna watch this flower grow
Right through the cracks

I've got to shed all the skin if I want the distance
Let the sun in, pull out the weeds and focus my vision
'Cause there's no mistakes, just bends and breaks and friction
But do you know the hotter the fire, the purer the gold is?

'Cause I am resilient
A full flower moment
Won't let the concrete hold me back, oh yeah
I am resilient
Born to be brilliant
I'm gonna grow right through the cracks
Oh
'Cause I died every winter
But survived all the weather
Look at me now, look at me now
I'm in full bloom, yeah
They tried to poison the water
But I was a little stronger
Look at me now, look at me now
I light up the room, oh yeah

'Cause I am resilient (I am resilient)
A full flower moment
Won't let the concrete hold me back, no
Oh, I am resilient
Born to be brilliant
I'm gonna grow right through the cracks
Oh, you're gonna watch this flower grow
Right through the cracks

Under a silver moon, tropical temperature
I feel my lotus bloom
Come closer
I want your energy, I want your aura
You are my destiny, my mantra

I never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight
Oh, oh-oh-oh

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers
We could be legendary (La la la la la)
Legendary lovers
We should be legendary (La la la la la)

Go down in history, go down together
Into infinity, forever
Your Cleopatra, your blushing Juliet
Anything for your love, a ride or die
Oh, I never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight
Oh, oh-oh-oh

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers
We could be legendary (La la la la la)
Legendary lovers
We should be legendary (La la la la la)

(Check it out)
Legendary lovers, legendary lovers, legendary lovers

Oh, take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers
We could be legendary (La la la la la)
Legendary lovers (Legendary lovers)
We should be legendary (La la la la la)
Oh, take me down to the river
Underneath (Underneath the sun) the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum (Oh baby, legendary lovers)
Legendary lovers
We could be legendary (La la la la la)
Legendary lovers
We should be legendary (La la la la la)

You got patina, ain't so green, nah
You earned this spot, got your receipts, yeah
Funny, gotta add addendums to your dreams
Still you never sleep, no
You never sleep, ah
Oh, you learned to dance, to bob and weave, yeah
To let that water roll off easy, yeah
You grew yourself above the weeds
Taller than the trees, oh

So, don't try and reinvent your wheel
'Cause you're too original
Baby, just stay classic
Ain't broke, ain't broke, don't fix it
Your highs, your lows, just ride it

It's a pendulum, it all comes back around
It's a pendulum, it's a pendulum
Life's a pendulum, it'll all come back around

It's a pendulum, it all comes back, it all comes back

Electric

In the dark, when you feel lost
Wanna be the best, but at what cost?
If you're gonna stay here
Nothing's ever changin', no
Big world, gotta see it all
Gotta get up even when you fall
There's no point in waitin', no

(Oh) They'll try to bring you down
(Oh) But you've got the power now

I know you feel it (Feel it)
If you believe it, then you can
There's no reason that this life can't be
Electric
Oh, I can see it, see it
If you believe it, then you can
There's no reason that this life can't be
Electric (Yeah)
Long road, got a ways to go
Took a big step, but you're not alone
'Cause we got each other
There's so much you'll discover
Headstrong, but your heart is stronger
Stay calm walkin' through the fire
I know you're gonna make it out

(Oh) They'll try to bring you down
(Oh) But you've got the power now

I know you feel it, feel it
If you believe it, then you can
There's no reason that this life can't be
Electric
Oh, I can see it, see it
If you believe it, then you can
There's no reason that this life can't be
Electric

Is it the way I talk sweet?
The way my skin is soft?
Or how I can be a bitch?
Make you keep your fingers crossed?
Is it the way that I praise you?
The way that I please you?
Or how fast I change my mind
And get scared that I might leave you?

Could spend your whole life, but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
She's always been a perfect mystery
Could spend your whole life, but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
And that's what makes a woman to me

Is it the way I cut my hair
And put no makeup on?
I feel most beautiful
Doing what the fuck I want
Is it that my intuition
Is never really off?
I need tissues for my issues
And Band-Aids for my heart
Could spend your whole life, but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
She's always been a perfect mystery
Could spend your whole life, but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
And that's what makes a woman to me

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
That's what makes a woman to me
Oh, oh (Oh yeah, yeah-yeah)
Oh, oh

Is it the way we keep
The whole world turning
In a pair of heels?
Yeah, that's what makes a woman
(There it is, Katheryn)

Have you ever lost, lost the light in your life?
Have you ever left, left yourself behind?
Have you ever lied and just replied "I'm fine"?
'Cause I can see you've lost, lost the light in your life

Wanna run like your mascara
Wine-stained lips talkin' to the mirror
If the sun comes up, don't even care at all

Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Promise one day, baby, they're gonna dry
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes

If love has left you with, with a question mark
If trust has left you fallin' in nobody's arms

If you wanna hide like your emotions
Heart can't break, it's already broken
If the sun comes up, don't even care at all
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Promise one day, baby, they're gonna dry
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes

Wanna run like your mascara
Wine-stained lips talkin' to the mirror
If the sun comes up, don't even care at all

Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes (Oh)
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Promise one day, baby, they're gonna dry
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes

Keep on dancin' (Oh, oh)
Keep on dancin' (Oh)
Keep on dancin' (Oh)
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes

Only love, only love
Only love, only love

Eighty-six thousand, four hundred seconds in a day
I swear lately most of 'em have been a waste
I feel 'em come and go, bury my mistakes
But time just goes on and on in a way

If I had one day left to live
And if the stars went out on me, the truth is
Yeah, there's so much I'd say and do
If I had nothing to lose, nah, nothing to lose

Oh, I'd call my mother and tell her I'm sorry
I never call her back
I'd pour my heart and soul out into a letter
And send it to my dad
Like, oh my God, the time I've wasted
Lost in my head
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead
Give me
Only love, only love
Give me
Only love, only love

I swear sometimes I hear myself talking, getting mad
Take shit so personal, like it really matters
Oh, am I awake, am I sleepwalking? Tell me that
It's scary how quickly I lose perspective and I react

If I had one day left to live
And if the stars went out on me, the truth is
Yeah, there's so much I'd say and do
If I had nothing to lose, no, nothing to lose

Oh, I'd call my mother and tell her I'm sorry
I never call her back
I'd pour my heart and soul out into a letter
And send it to my dad
Like, oh my God, the time I've wasted
Lost in my head
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead
Give me
Only love, only love
Give me
Only love, only love (No)
Yeah, give me
Only love, only love
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead
Give me (Mmm)
Only love, only love (Only love, only love)
Give me
Only love, only love (Only love, only love, only love)
Only love, only love (Oh, no, only love)
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me (Oh)
And take the love instead

Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead
Give me
Only love, only love
Yeah, give me
Only love, only love

You sent a text
It's like the wind changed your mind
We were best friends
Yeah, we were building a life
With every kiss and every letter
Every promise of forever
Oh, but you hit "send"
And disappeared in front of my eyes

And now you're just a ghost
(When I look back, never woulda known that)
You could be so cold
(Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor)
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/
I see through you now

Something has died
Now that I have made up my mind
(I'll be alright) I'll be alright
It doesn't haunt me at night
'Cause every gift and every letter
Every promise of forever
Now, is out of sight
Like you were never alive
And now you're just a ghost
(When I look back, never woulda known that)
You could be so cold
(Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor)
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/
I see through you now

Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
So, rest in peace
I'll see you on the other side

And now you're just a ghost
(When I look back, never woulda known that)
You could be so cold
(Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor)
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/
I see through you
Now, now, now, now, now
Oh, now, now, now, now, now
I see through you now
Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
I see through you now

No one knows, knows where my mind goes
I keep you on the low, I must confess
I've been painting us, the picture makes me blush
My imagination at its best

I could put us on an island
I could put us in a mansion
I could put us in a back seat, yeah
You're anywhere I want you to be

I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby

Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
No, they'll never know about us
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
As long as I keep you tucked
Tucked deep, deep in my fantasy
'Cause, in reality, we're a mistake
Don't need permission to do what I do to you
When all you are to me's a sweet escape

I could put us on an island
I could put us in a mansion
I could put us in a back seat, yeah
You're anywhere I want you to be

I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby

Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na (Baby)
Na-na-na-na
No, they'll never know about us
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na (Baby)
Na-na-na-na
As long as I keep you tucked
I'll keep you
Yeah, I'll keep you, baby
No one knows, knows where my mind goes
I keep you on the low, I must confess
You're someone that I should forget
Oh, woah, oh, yeah

I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby (Anytime, anytime, anytime)
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby (Oh)

Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na (Baby)
Na-na-na-na
No, they'll never know about us
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na (Baby)
Na-na-na-na
As long as I keep you tucked

I lost my tug of war today
Took my foot off of the brakes
(The definition of insanity is looping on repeat, and expecting things to change)
But what comes up must hit the ground
So I drink these anvils down
(She always comes to me highly disguised, an angel whispering, so many pretty shapes)

It's a dance with the devil
A stumbling tango
It's a dance with the devil
Trying to borrow from tomorrow

It's a dance
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
It's a dance
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
It's a dance

Just want to connect
But you won't let me do it
So I get altered, (Twisted and conflicted, so I casually can shoot the shit)
Wish less was going on
Wish I could just throw the ball
And ignore it all
(Constantly distracted by the noise of my ping-pong)
It's a dance with the devil
A mercurial wrestle
It's a dance with the devil
Trying to borrow from tomorrow

It's a dance
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
It's a dance
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
It's a...
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)

But what, what is it worth
Waking up with a crown of clouds?
What is it worth
When my head spins out with doubt?
Wish I could measure
When the poison is pouring out
Oh...
It's a dance
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you (It's a dance)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you (It's a dance)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you (It's a dance)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
Oh, no, oh, no (It's a...)

I'm thirty-something going on thirteen
Still a sponge to everything
Saucer eyes wide, yeah, I still believe
And a sparkle in my steps
Smiling with my teeth

They say that I might lose my Midas touch
They also say I may become irrelevant
But who the fuck are they anyway?
I don't care what they say

I won't act my age
Time is just an invention man has made
No, I won't act my age
It's just my reflection that is out of date
'Cause it's all in your attitude
It's all in your point of view
I won't act my age
Just need a little bit of Peter Pan and some imagination
No, I won't act my age

So, I recommend that you lose your mind
It was the only thing that was keeping me behind
They say curb your curiosity
They also say prepare to amend your dreams
But who the fuck are they anyway?
I don't care what they say

'Cause I won't act my age
Time is just an invention man has made
No, I won't act my age
It's just my reflection that is out of date
'Cause it's all in your attitude
It's all in your point of view
I won't act my age (c'mon)
Just need a little bit of Peter Pan and some imagination
No, I won't act my age

How old would you be? Yeah
How old would you really be
If you didn't know, yeah
How old you really were?
How old would you be? Yeah
How old would you really be
If you didn't know (Know)
How old you really were?
(Hey!)
I won't act my age
Time is just an invention man has made
No, I won't act my age
It's just my reflection that is out of date
'Cause it's all in your attitude
It's all in your point of view
I won't act my age
Just need a little bit of Peter Pan and some imagination
No, I won't act my age

Oh-oh, I won't act my age
Ooh, yeah, ooh
Ooh, yeah, ooh
I won't act my age

I can see it happening
Happen, I can see it happening
Happen, I can see it

Can't go with the flow, got to make waves
Even though I look at the sand, and I'm just one grain
But my intuition says there's a bigger mission I must embrace
So I'm, I'm pushing my thoughts to a new place

I'm kicking and screaming
'Cause it won't be easy
To break all the patterns
If I'm not evolving
I'm just another robot
Taking up oxygen

It's something bigger than me
I can feel it beginning
Something bigger than me
Yeah, I can feel it opening
Tried to ignore it
But it keeps on growing
Out of control
It's something bigger than me
And I can feel it happening
So I'll speak my truth though my voice shakes (I can see it)
Try to summon the strength to look fear in the face

But I'm kicking and screaming
'Cause it won't be easy
To break all the patterns
If I'm not evolving
I'm just another robot
Taking up oxygen

It's something bigger than me
I can feel it beginning
Something bigger than me
Yeah, I can feel it opening
Tried to ignore it
But it keeps on growing
Out of control (out of control)
It's something bigger than me
And I can feel it happening

Happening (Oh-ah, oh-ah, oh-ah)
Happen, I can see it happening
Happen, I can see it happening (Oh-ah, oh-ah, oh-ah)
Happen, I can see it happening
I can see it, I can see it, I can see it happening
It's something bigger than me
Something bigger than me
Yeah, I can feel it opening
Tried to ignore it
But it keeps on growing
Out of control (Out of control)
It's something bigger than me
And I can feel it happening

Happening (I can feel it)
Happen, (I can see it) I can see it happening
(I can feel it)
Happen, I can see it

I built a wall so high, no one could reach
A life of locks, I swallowed all the keys
I was petrified, only knew how to hide
They can't hurt me if they don't know me
A full facade made a mirage outta me

Then you came and started digging for a treasure underneath
And you found a better version of me I had never seen

Into me, you see
Into me, you see
You broke me wide open, open sesame
Into me, you see
Into me, you see
You got me wide open, now I'm ready
Is this intimacy?

I was a ship floating aimlessly
So camouflaged, was my own worst enemy

Then you came in like a sailor with a heart that anchored me
And every day, I wake up grateful I'm no longer lost at sea
Into me, you see
Into me, you see
You broke me wide open, open sesame
Into me, you'll see
Into me, you'll see
You got me wide open, now I'm ready
Is this intimacy?

Oh, 'cause no one's ever seen me like this
Seen right through the bullshit
I pray that I can keep unfolding
Pray that I can just stay open
Just stay open, just stay open, just stay open

Oh, 'cause you broke me wide open, open sesame
Into me, you'll see
Into me, you'll see
You got me wide open and now I'm ready
This is intimacy

You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi
'Cause you're hungover and I'm broke
I lost my fake ID
But you lost the motel key
Spare me your freakin' dirty looks now
Don't blame me

You wanna cash out
And get the hell outta town
Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

Why are these lights so bright?
Did we get hitched last night?
Dressed up like Elvis
Why am I wearing your class ring?
Don't call your mother
'Cause now we're partners in crime
Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

You got me into this
Information overload, situation lost control
Send out an S. O. S.
(Oh) Ha, and get some cash out
(Oh) We're gonna tear up the town
(Oh) No, don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me, told me, told me
Oh, yeah

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
That's what you get, baby
Shake the glitter
Shake, shake, shake the glitter
Gimme some cash out, baby
Gimme some cash out, baby

You're a one-of-a-one, a one-of-a-kind
That you only find once in a lifetime
Made to fit like a fingerprint
A code that clicks open the gold mine
They say one man's trash is another man's treasure
When I found you, it was all pitter-patter
Secretly, I hit the lottery
'Cause you're brighter than all of the Northern Lights
You speak to me, even in my dreams
Wouldn't let you go for even the highest price
They say one man's trash is another girl's treasure
So if it's up to me, I'm gonna keep you forever
'Cause I understand you
We see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find
Was a phenomenon when you came along
Yeah, our chemistry was more than science
It was deafening, loud like lightning
It was striking, you couldn't deny it
They say one man's trash is another man's treasure
The two of us together make everything glitter

'Cause I understand you
We see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find
To the bottom of the sea, I'd go to find you (Oh)
Climb the highest peak to be right beside you (Oh)
Every step I take, I'm keeping you in mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

'Cause I understand you
We see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go (And wherever you go), so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find
It's hard to find
Oh, it's hard to find
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime

Everybody's in a hurry, in a flurry
Shopping 'til they're droppin' in the snow
Kids are cryin', dogs are barkin'
Catchin' up with folks we barely know
Sure, it's madness, but it's magic
As soon as you hang up the mistletoe
'Cause you're the reason for the season
No, we don't need to keep up with the Jones

Our love is something priceless

I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

So, Mr. Santa (Mr. Santa)
Take the day off (Take the day off)
Get a massage (Get a massage)
'Cause we've got this one all under control
A little whiskey (A little whiskey)
We're getting frisky (Ooh!)
And slow dancing to Nat King Cole
No, we ain't stressin' (We ain't stressin')
Just caressin' (Mm-hmm)
Warming up our popsicle toes
Nothing's missin' (Nothing's missin')
'Cause you're a blessin' ('Cause you're the blessin')
Yeah, you're the only one I'm wishing for
Our love is something priceless

I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

I don't need anything
Take back all the Cartier, and the Tiffany's and the Chanel
Well, can I keep that Chanel? Please?
No, no, no, no

I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

(Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la)
Just you and me, under a tree
(Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la)
A cozy little Christmas here with you

I'm losing all direction
Slipping into quicksand
I've shattered the illusion
Seen behind the curtain
I'm disenchanted
Dancing on a wire
Juggling desire
Every hit gets harder
When you're fighting without armor
I'm disheartened

Do I start over, rediscover?
Submit to the sweet surrender

It's a mind maze, all these head games
Caught in a cage (Caught in a cage), a complex cage
Am I a car on fire?
Will I be devoured?
I gotta free myself and get out of my own way

I used to be so sparkling
But now it's not so charming
What used to stimulate me
Now can barely wake me
I'm unresponsive
Will I find salvation?
Some kind of moderation?
Spinning all these plates is
Gonna be a challenge
A delicate balance
So do I start over, rediscover?
Submit to the sweet surrender

It's a mind maze, all these head games
Caught in a cage (Caught in a cage), a complex cage
Am I a car on fire?
Will I be devoured?
I gotta free myself and get out of my own way

Get out of my own way
Get out of my own way
Get out of my own way

So do I start over, re-rediscover?
I submit to your, your sweet surrender
Your sweet surrender
Your sweet surrender
No

I lost myself in fear of losing you
I wish I didn't do, but I did
I lost my own, my own identity
Forgot that you picked me for me

But now, I don't negotiate with insecurities
They always seem to get the best of me
I found I had to love myself the way I wanted you to
Love me

No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to love me

Sometimes I wish my skin was a costume
That I could just unzip and strip
But who I am is who I'm meant to be
And it's who you are in love, in love with
So now, I don't negotiate with insecurities
They're going to have to take a back seat
I know I have to love myself the way I want you to
Love me

No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to love me

No more standing in my own way (Let's go deeper, let's get closer)
No more standing in my own way (The way I want you to love me)
No more standing in my own way (Let's go deeper, let's get closer)
No more standing in my own way (The way I want you to love me)

No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing my feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to love me
No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to love me

"This is the last time," you say
After the last line you break
It's not even a holiday
Nothin' to celebrate ('Brate, 'brate, 'brate)
You give a hundred reasons why
And say you're really gonna try
If I had a nickel for every time
I'd own the bank (Bank, bank, bank)

Thought that I was the exception
I could reroute your addiction
You could've been the greatest
But you'd rather get wasted

You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not stickin' around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fuckin' mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain

You say it helps you write your rhymes
Whatever helps you sleep at night
You become what you despise
A stereotype-type-type-type
You think you're so rock and roll
But you're really just a joke
Had the world in the palm of your hands
But you fuckin' cho-o-o-oked
Should've been my teammate
Could've changed your fate
You say that you love me
You won't remember in the morning

You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not stickin' around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fuckin' mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain

(Nine, one, one)
(Nine, one, one)
(Nine, one, one)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not stickin' around to watch you go down
(I'm not stickin' around, I'm not stickin' around)
Wanna be your lover, not your fuckin' mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain
(You're goin' down, you're goin' down)
(You're goin' down, you're goin' down, I know)
You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not stickin' around to watch you go down

Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air

He put it on me, I put it on
Like there was nothing wrong
It didn't fit, it wasn't right
Wasn't just the size
They say you know when you know
I don't know

I didn't feel the fairytale feeling, no
Am I a stupid girl
For even dreaming that I could?

If it's not like the movies
That's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one, I'll come undone
And my world will stop spinning
And that's just the beginning, yeah

Snow White said when I was young
"One day my prince will come"
So I wait for that date
They say it's hard to meet your match
Gotta find my better half
So we make perfect shapes
If stars don't align, if it doesn't stop time
If you can't see the sign
Wait for it
One hundred percent, worth every penny spent
He'll be the one that finishes your sentences

If it's not like the movies
That's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one, he'll come undone
And my world will stop spinning
And that's just the beginning, oh-oh yeah

'Cause I know you're out there
And you're, you're looking for me
Oh-oh-oh
It's a crazy idea that
You were made perfectly for me, you see

Just like the movies
That's how it will be
Cinematic and dramatic, with the perfect ending, ohh
It's not like the movies, oh
But that's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one, you'll come undone
And your world will stop spinning
And it's just the beginning

Is Mercury in retrograde?
Or is that the excuse that I've always made?
'Cause I wanna blame you
But I can only blame myself
Yeah, it's easy to throw you under the bus
Or call you crazy, while filling my cup
I say these things to hurt you
But I only hurt myself

Oh, I can only take responsibility for me

It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh yeah
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first, baby, to say "I'm sorry" (I'm sorry)

I've faced my demons, yeah, I paid my dues
I had to grow up, I wish you could too
I wanted to save you
But I can only save myself
Oh, I can only be the change I want to see
Yeah, to see

It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, yeah, oh
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first, baby, to say "I'm sorry" (I'm sorry)

I point my finger, but it does me no good
I look in the mirror and it tells me the truth, yeah
Why are these lessons always learned the hard way?
Is it too late to change?

Oh, it takes two (It takes two)
Two sides to every story
Not just you (Not you)
I can't keep ignoring
And I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh
It takes two (It takes two)
Two sides to every story
Not just me (Not me)
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first, baby, to say "I'm sorry" (I'm sorry)
I'm sorry

You make me feel like I'm losing my virginity
The first time, every time when you're touching me
I make you bloom like a flower that you never seen
Under the sun, we are one buzzing energy
Let's pollinate to create a family tree
This evolution with you comes naturally
Some call it science (Science), we call it chemistry
This is the story of the birds and the bees

And even when seasons change
Our love still stays the same

You give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat

I've flown a million miles, just to find a magic seed
A white flower, with the power to bring life to me
You're so exotic, get my whole body fluttering
Constantly craving for a taste of your sticky sweet
Always on the brink of a heart attack
You keep me alive and keep me coming back
I see the sun rise in your eyes, your eyes
We've got a future full of blue skies, blue skies
And even when seasons change
Our love still stays the same

You give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat

You love me, you love me
Never love me not, not, oh no
When we're in a perfect harmony
You make me sound like, like a symphony, oh

Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Oh, spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah (Oh, hey, yeah), hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah (Oh, hey, yeah), hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat, beat, beat, beat

Can you tell me, who called a race?
Can anyone stay in one place?
And when you get to the finish line
Will you wish for more time?
But see, one day
One day you will
But maybe one day you will find
That you just can't push rewind

All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now

Do you ever think that, we're just chasing our tails?
Like life is one big fast treadmill
And we pop what is prescribed
If it gets us first prize
But you know who I, who I think will win
Are the ones that let love in
Are the ones that take the time
All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?

Be here with me now
Be here with me now
'Cause the future is right now, right in front on you
Don't let the clock, the clock tell you what to do
Our future is right now, I'm in front of you
Baby, don't blink and miss this moment

Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now

Yeah-eh, yeah

I can feel a Phoenix inside of me
As I march alone to a different beat
Slowly swallowing down my fear
Yeah, yeah
I am ready for the road less traveled
Suiting up for my crowning battle
This test is my own cross to bear
But I will get there

It's never easy to be chosen, never easy to be called
Standing on the frontline when the bombs start to fall
I can see the heavens, but I still hear the flames
Calling out my name

I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?

I can feel this light that's inside of me
Growing fast into a bolt of lightning
I know one spark will shock the world, yeah yeah
So I pray for favor like Esther
I need your strength to handle the pressure
I know there will be sacrifice
But that's the price
It's never easy to be chosen, never easy to be called
Standing on the frontline when the bombs start to fall
I can see the heavens, but I still hear the flames
Calling out my name

I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?

At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Don't let the greatness get you down
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Don't let the greatness get you down
Oh-oh-oh, yeah
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?

At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?

You are my hurt locker lover
Keep me walking on a wire
Don't know when you'll blow
So I tiptoe through your triggered mind
You fight me, but I'm on your side
Defeated, now retreating

Why you tryna make me your enemy?
All we really need is a little peace
I just wanna be your lover
Oh, this is not a competition
So baby, why the ammunition?
I don't wanna be the last one standing

Choose your battles, babe
Then you'll win the war
Stop digging your own grave
When there's so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
I am not fighting anymore

I've tried to pick off your red flags
While dancing on broken glass
Your mind games hit like grenades
Feel cursed, just like the Kennedys
But you somehow get me on my knees
Defeated, now retreating
Why you tryna make me your enemy?
All we really need is a little peace
I just wanna be your lover
Oh, this is not a competition
So baby, why the ammunition?
I don't wanna be the last one standing

Choose your battles, babe
Then you'll win the war
Stop digging your own grave
When there's so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
No, I am not fighting anymore

If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby, baby
I am not fighting anymore
If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
I don't wanna fight no more, anyway, anyway
I am not fighting anymore
(If you wanna go, then go) Choose your battles, babe
(If you wanna stay, then stay) Then you'll win the war
('Cause I don't wanna fight no more) Stop digging your own grave
(Baby, baby) When there's so much to live for
(If you wanna go, then go) Choose your battles, babe
(If you wanna stay, then stay) 'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
(I don't wanna fight no more, anyway, anyway)
I am not fighting anymore

If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby, baby
I am not fighting anymore
If you wanna go, then go

Lay me down at your altar, baby
I'm a slave to this love
Your electric lips have got me speaking in tongues
I have prayed for a power like you
To see deep down in my soul
Oh, you make me bloom like a flower, a desert rose

Magical one, a mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holy hell and Heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally healed

This is spiritual, under your spell
Phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, all aglow
Like a feather, you make me float

Flying high as a kite on your love
Lost in sweet ecstasy
Found a Nirvana finally
Magical one, a mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holy hell and Heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally healed

This is spiritual, under your spell
Phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, all aglow
Like a feather, you make me float

You make me float
You make me float

This is spiritual, under your spell
So phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel (Like an angel), all aglow (Oh)
Like a feather (Like a feather), you make me float

Oh, oh-oh
You make me float
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, you make me float

She is a pyramid
But with him, she's just a grain of sand
This loves too strong, like Mice and Men
Squeezing out the life that should be let in
She was a hurricane
But now she's just a gust of wind
She used to set the sails of a thousand ships
Was a force to be reckoned with

She could be a Statue of Liberty
She could be a Joan of Arc
But he's scared of the light that's inside of her
So he keeps her in the dark

Oh, she used to be a pearl, oh
Yeah, she used to rule the world, oh
Can't believe she's become a shell of herself
'Cause she used to be a pearl

She was unstoppable
Move fast just like an avalanche
But now she's stuck deep in cement
Wishing that they never ever met
She could be a Statue of Liberty
She could be a Joan of Arc
But he's scared of the light that's inside of her
So he keeps her in the dark

Oh, she used to be a pearl, oh
Yeah, she used to rule the world, oh
Can't believe she's become a shell of herself
'Cause she used to be a...

Do you know that there's a way out?
There's a way out, there's a way out, there's a way out
You don't have to be held down
Be held down, be held down, be held down

'Cause I used to be a shell
Yeah, I let him rule my world, my world, oh yeah!
But I woke up and grew strong and I can still go on
And no one can take my pearl

You don't have to be a shell, no
You're the one that rules your world, oh
You are strong and you'll learn that you can still go on
And you'll always be a, a pearl
She is unstoppable
